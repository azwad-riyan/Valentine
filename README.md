## About

This is a fun, slightly mischievous, and definitely unconventional Valentine's Day "program" designed to playfully ask someone "Will you be my Valentine?".  Instead of a boring text message, send them this "suspicious file" and see what happens!

**Warning:**  This program is meant to be lighthearted and fun.  Make sure the person you send it to has a good sense of humor and is comfortable with a little bit of digital trickery!  Sending "suspicious files" can be alarming in other contexts, so use this responsibly and with someone you know well.

## It has two version:

*   **Valentine:**  If someone manage to press no it will open 100 new clone of that app as penalty.
*   **Valentine Simple:**  It doesn't have any penalty part, just simple yes/no.

## Features


*   **The Big Question:**  Presents a clear and simple "Will you be my Valentine?" prompt in a window.
*   **Evasive "NO" Button:**  The "NO" button is not so easily clicked! It dynamically moves away from the cursor, making it a fun challenge to even attempt to say "no".
*   **"YES" Leads to Sweetness:** Clicking "YES" reveals a heartfelt Valentine's message in the same window.
*   **"NO" Unleashes Chaos (Punishment!):**  If, against all odds, the "NO" button is clicked... prepare for a cascade of 100 new "Valentine?" windows to pop up!(I've decreased the value to 10 in hte exe file as I Dont want to crash my crash's system)  It's a playful (and slightly overwhelming) consequence for rejecting the Valentine's offer.
*   **Pre-built EXE for Beginners:**  For those less familiar with Python, a pre-compiled `.exe` file is provided for easy execution on Windows.

## How to Run

There are two ways to run this program, depending on your technical comfort level:

**1. Running the Python Script (`.py` file - For Python Users):**

   If you have Python installed on your system (Python 3.x is recommended), this is the recommended way to run the program if you want to understand and potentially modify the code.

   *   **Prerequisites:**
        *   Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/).
        *   Ensure you have `tkinter` installed. It's usually included with standard Python installations. If not, you can install it via pip: `pip install tk`

   *   **Steps:**
        1.  Download the `main.py` file from this repository.
        2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
        3.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the `.py` file using the `cd` command (e.g., `cd Downloads` if you saved it in your Downloads folder).
        4.  Run the script using the command: `python main.py` (or `python3 main.py` depending on your Python setup).

   *   The "Valentine?" window should appear!

**2. Running the Pre-built Executable (`.exe` file - For Beginners):**

   For users who are not familiar with Python or just want a quick and easy way to run the program on Windows, a pre-compiled `.exe` file is provided.

   *   **Prerequisites:** None!  You just need a Windows computer.

   *   **Steps:**
        1.  Download the `valentine.exe` file from the [release section](https://github.com/azwad-riyan/Valentine/releases) of this repository (if available) or from wherever you obtained it.
        2.  Simply double-click the `valentine.exe` file.

   *   The "Valentine?" window should appear!


## Disclaimer & Use Responsibly!

*   **"Suspicious File" is a Joke:**  The "suspicious file" aspect is purely for comedic effect and to enhance the playful surprise of the Valentine's Day proposal.  **Do not use this to distribute actual malware or harmful software.**
*   **Punishment Windows Can Be Overwhelming:**  Clicking "NO" will indeed open 100 windows. Be prepared to close them!  It's part of the fun, but just be aware of it.
*   **Recipient's Humor:**  Make absolutely sure the person you are sending this to will find it funny and not be genuinely alarmed or annoyed.  Know your audience!
